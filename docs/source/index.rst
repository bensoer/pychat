PyChat Documentation
====================
PyChat is a UDP based terminal chatting program that allows multiple devices to communicate together over a secure
connection using an algorithm of their choice. The purpose of the project is to explore encryption algorithms and
sending data back and forth securely and minimizing options for external sources to decrypt the data. The project is
maintained by `Ben Soer <https://github.com/bensoer>`_ and `Kurtis Bohlen <https://github.com/kbohlen>`_.
